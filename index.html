  <h1>Welcome to the TheCUBE game Privacy policy!</h1>

  <p>As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.</p>

  <h2>Data collected by the app</h2>

  <p>I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. </p>
  <p>All data created by the you (the user) is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. </p>
  <p>No analytics software is present in the app either.</p>
